## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
The Solid protocol aims at giving more autonomy and control of the users over their data.
<!-- Need         -->
I propose that the guarantee of privacy and choice on the part of the user is not enough, 
we also need to create a state of affairs where the computational power can be produced 
by the user of the app themselves instead of delegated it to a third party.
<!-- Task         -->
For this doctoral research, I am introducing the concept of Collaborative Link Traversal Query Processing, a SPARQL
query processing paradigm for Link Traversal, where multiple query engine
collaborate together to increase their query results completeness and reduce their query execution time.
<!-- Object       -->
In this paper I formalize the objective of my research, document my method and anchor it with the current state of the art.
<!-- Findings     -->
Doing so, I divided the cooperation of query engines into two parts; exploration of the search space and caching.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
I am planning to create a prototype and evaluated it using benchmark found in the literature.
<!-- Perspectives -->
Given, the current state of the art, I am confident that it's possible to create this paradigm and that this contribution has scientific novelty.

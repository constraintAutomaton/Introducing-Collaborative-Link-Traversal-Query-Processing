## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
<span class="comment" data-author="RT">Same as for title, let's start broader than Solid, but then you could give Solid as one example.</span>
The Solid protocol aims at giving more autonomy and control of the users over their data.
<!-- Need         -->
<span class="comment" data-author="RT">Maybe you can first briefly say what the benefits of decentralization and Solid are.</span>
I propose that the guarantee of privacy and choice on the part of the user is not enough, 
we also need to create a state of affairs where the computational power can be produced 
by the user of the app themselves instead of delegated it to a third party.<span class="comment" data-author="RT">But why? (playing devils-advocate here, the need has to be really clear)</span>
<!-- Task         -->
For this doctoral research, I am introducing the concept of Collaborative Link Traversal Query Processing, a SPARQL
query processing paradigm for Link Traversal<span class="comment" data-author="RT">Link Traversal is new here, we'll need to briefly introduce it first</span>, where multiple query engine
collaborate together to increase their query results completeness and reduce their query execution time.
<span class="comment" data-author="RT">I'm wondering if we really need to tie this to link traversal at this stage. We could also talk about discovery-based querying over the web, with link traversal as one specific approach you will look into.</span>
<!-- Object       -->
In this paper I formalize the objective of my research, document my method and anchor it with the current state of the art.
<!-- Findings     -->
Doing so, I divided the cooperation of query engines into two parts; exploration of the search space and caching.
<span class="comment" data-author="RT">And why will these 2 parts solve the need you have identified?</span>
<!-- Conclusion   -->
I will create a prototype and evaluate it using existing benchmarks.
<!-- Perspectives -->
<span class="comment" data-author="RT">Instead of saying you're confident and that this is novel, say *why* it is novel, whereby as a consequence you will be confident.</span>
Given the current state of the art, I am confident that it is possible to create this paradigm and that this contribution has scientific novelty.

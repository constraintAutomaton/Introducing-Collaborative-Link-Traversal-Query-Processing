##  Preliminary Results
{:#preliminary_results}

In my current state of affaire, I have surveyed part of the literature as presented in [](#litterature_review),
I have also investigated the usage of the protocol [IPFS](cite:cites spec:ipfs) for
a backend of our P2P network in relation to the communication of the SPARQL query engine [Comunica](cite:cites taelman_iswc_resources_comunica_2018).
I am also participating in a group with other researchers to investigate how to use Solid for the use case of social media applications
and medical applications in a  P2P manner and while preserving privacy.
Lastly, I experimented with GLTQP in Comunica for the use case of fragmented databases.

## Introduction
{:#introduction}

The [Solid Protocol](cite:cites spec:solid), is an effort,
based on the W3C TAG Ethical Web Principles [](cite:cites spec:w3Ethical),
to "realise a space where individuals can maintain their autonomy,
control their data and privacy, and choose applications and services to fulfil their needs
"[](cite:cites spec:solid) while using existing web standards.
In the context of Solid [](cite:cites verstraete2022solid) defined data sovereignty as 
"the power an individual has over their data.[...][It is] the self-determination of 
individuals and organizations with regard to the use of their data "[](cite:cites verstraete2022solid)
and a state of being in control of our data is obtained
"[w]hen an individual or an organization [...] can choose where [its] data is stored and who is granted access to it.
This decentralization of data control and storage results in breaking
through existing data silos."[](cite:cites verstraete2022solid)

[](cite:cites Smyrnaios2018) contextualize and historicize the commodification of the internet. 
The paper proposes that at its inception the web was not really built as an equitable and empowering place, even if at its beginning it was seeing and used as a public good. 
The birth of the internet, ARPANET, was a US military project, funded by US taxpayer money, private companies
were not interested in investing in this technology.
In the 1970-80's, 
"the internet was both invented and
developed by a ‘republic of computer scientists’[...] no gap between design and use [existed]. In other words, ARPANET’s designers were also its first users,
giving them the power to change the orientation of technical inventions and their implementation according to their own interests and needs.
[...] while it was the very epitome of a technocratic apparatus designed for war,
it came to represent a tool for individual freedom and a more harmonious society."
[](cite:cites Smyrnaios2018)
The internet has public good was not really met to be interacting with the public, the general masses, it's private companies for profit driven goals
that brought computers, the core interface of the internet to the common citizen when they saw its potential profitability [](cite:cites Smyrnaios2018).
Seeing the internet has an object in history, built from a concrete environment with its own dynamic influencing its design and usage, and in return it influencing and making history, appear to be a good start to understand why the internet does not have fulfilled its promise of 
active participation, global understanding and higher form of democracy, and instead seems to have in large proportion reproduce the structure from which it was born
and even in some regards amplifies certain social problematic elements [](cite:cites Curran2016ch1).


In the context of this PhD program, I propose to investigate a more socialistic and decomodificalistic approach to Solid 
in contrast to the more corporative [](cite:cites Rizwan2021) and capitalistic current approach. 
By this shift, I attempt to move the definition of power and control, from a more consumer choice, the right to choose who will use my data,
to the right of the user to be part of the production of the computational power necessary to make an app work,
hence making so that communities can control what app can do. 
If the computational power is in the hand of a third party,
this party will always have "the real" control over the application.
At its most basic expression, it has the power to limit the access,
sure the user can choose another party, particularly with Solid, but this party will need to finance itself
in some ways either by charging a fee or by using the user as the product [](cite:cites Sevignani2013, Smyrnaios2018) (maybe with more "consent" with Solid).
Also, the cartelisation of the market is still a problem in the current paradigm,
and the increase of the gap between the rich and the poor [](cite:cites Curran2016ch1, Rizwan2021, Sevignani2013),
with consideration with the increasing presence of web technologies in day-to-day life, is also a problem not engaged with the current state of affaires.

<span class="comment" data-author="RT">The jump to Link Traversal is too sudden. It's unclear why link traversal is needed. We need some paragraphs inbetween. This could for example be about the need of decentralization, its challenges, and link traversal as a partial solution.</span>

In this research I focus on querying over Solid pods,
in a paradigm that I call Collaborative Link Traversal Query Processing (CLTQP) where every user can lend some of 
his computational power when querying to increase the query result completeness and reduce the query execution time of all the other users in a collaborative way,
so in some ways acting as one powerful querying engine.
In this perspective, apps are more shells that represent contracts and provide the tools to do the work,
the data are out there in the Solid pods and the open web and the computational power is also out there in the hand of the users.
With this collective participation, it would be possible at little cost (for example [](cite:cites Sevignani2013) in their studies most participants
were willing to pay 10 euro a year for alternative social media platforms,
which would equal to 50 million a year if all the users of Facebook were to do it) to provide a far greater democratic control
over applications that are interacting with the daily life of many individual.

This paper is divided as follows, first, the [research proposal is made](#proposal),
after the [related work](#litterature_review) is presented,
then the [research questions and hypotheses](#research_question) are formalized,
the [preliminary results are presented](#preliminary_results),
and the [evaluation methodology](#evaluation) is explained and there is a short [conclusion](#conclusion).

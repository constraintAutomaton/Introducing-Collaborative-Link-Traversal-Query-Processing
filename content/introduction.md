## Introduction
{:#introduction}

Decentralized web initiatives gives users more control over their data.
It can be formalized in a concept called data soverignty. [](cite:cites verstraete2022solid) defined this concept as 
"the power an individual has over their data.[...][It is] the self-determination of 
individuals and organizations with regard to the use of their data "[](cite:cites verstraete2022solid)
and a state of being in control of our data is obtained
"[w]hen an individual or an organization [...]
can choose where [its] data is stored and who is granted access to it."[](cite:cites verstraete2022solid)

In the context of this PhD program, I propose to investigate a more socialistic and decomodificalistic approach to decentralized web environments 
in contrast to the more corporative [](cite:cites Rizwan2021) and capitalistic [](cite:cites Terranova2000FreeLP, Curran2016ch1, Sevignani2013) current approach.
By this shift, I attempt to move the definition of power and control, from a more consumer choice, the right to choose who will use my data,
to the right of the users to generate collectively the computation power necessary
to make a social apps running by distributing between them the computational load.
For that, I focus on querying as in social applications, the request of information, the discovery of it
and its propagation are the main functionality of those apps,
are computationally demanding 
and are the mechanism by which users can become the product of those apps [](cite:cites Terranova2000FreeLP, Sevignani2013, Smyrnaios2018).
Concretely, I propose Collaborative Link Traversal Query Processing (CLTQP),
a Link Traversal Query Processing (LTQP) paradigm where every user can lend some of 
their computational power when querying to increase the query result completeness and 
reduce the query execution time of all the other users in a collaborative way,
so in some ways acting as one powerful querying engine.
With this collective participation, it would be possible at little cost to provide a democratic economic base from which
users could have the power to choose features for social applications that cater to their needs and from which
the monetary barrier over who can start a social application will be reduced.

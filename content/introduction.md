## Introduction
{:#introduction}

[Solid](cite:cites spec:solid) is a protocol that enables decentralized environment 
that focuses on privacy, it gives the opportunity to entities and moral entities to store
their data into private pods and decide which parties have access to it
[](cite:cites verstraete2022solid).
It is already used by multiple private companies [](cite:cites verstraete2022solid) and
the [Flemish government](https://www.vlaanderen.be/digitaal-vlaanderen/athumi-het-vlaams-datanutsbedrijf).
Solid can be described as an effort,
based on the [W3C TAG Ethical Web Principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/),
to "realise a space where individuals can maintain their autonomy,
control their data and privacy, and choose applications and services to fulfil their needs
"[](cite:cites spec:solid) while using existing web standards.
In the context of Solid [](cite:cites verstraete2022solid) defined data sovereignty as 
"the power an individual has over their data.[...][It is] the self-determination of 
individuals and organizations with regard to the use of their data "[](cite:cites verstraete2022solid)
and a state of being in control of our data is obtained
"[w]hen an individual or an organization [...] can choose where [its] data is stored and who is granted access to it."[](cite:cites verstraete2022solid)

In the context of this PhD program, I propose to investigate a more socialistic and decomodificalistic approach to Solid 
in contrast to the more corporative [](cite:cites Rizwan2021) and capitalistic [](cite:cites Terranova2000FreeLP, Curran2016ch1, Sevignani2013) current approach.
By this shift, I attempt to move the definition of power and control, from a more consumer choice, the right to choose who will use my data,
to the right of the user to be part of the production of the computational power necessary to make an app work,
hence making so that communities can control what app can do.
For that I focus on querying as in social applications, the request of information, the discovery of it
and its propagation are the main functionality of those app, 
hence the main center of power and the means of which users can become the product of those apps
[](cite:cites Terranova2000FreeLP, Sevignani2013, Smyrnaios2018).
Concretely I propose  Collaborative Link Traversal Query Processing (CLTQP)
a Link Traversal Query Processing (LTQP) paradigm where every user can lend some of 
his computational power when querying to increase the query result completeness and reduce the query execution time of all the other users in a collaborative way,
so in some ways acting as one powerful querying engine.
With this collective participation, it would be possible at little cost (for example [](cite:cites Sevignani2013) in their studies most participants
were willing to pay 10 euro a year for alternative social media platforms,
which would equal to 50 million a year if all the users of Facebook were to do it) to provide a far greater democratic control
over applications that are interacting with the daily life of many individuals.

This paper is divided as follows, first, the [research proposal is made](#proposal),
after the [related work](#litterature_review) is presented,
then the [research questions and hypotheses](#research_question) are formalized,
the [preliminary results are presented](#preliminary_results),
and the [evaluation methodology](#evaluation) is explained and there is a short [conclusion](#conclusion).

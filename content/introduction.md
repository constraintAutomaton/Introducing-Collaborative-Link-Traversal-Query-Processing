## Introduction
{:#introduction}

Decentralized web initiatives give users more control over their data.
It can be formalized in a concept called data sovereignty. [](cite:cites verstraete2022solid) defined this concept as 
"the power an individual has over their data."[](cite:cites verstraete2022solid).
It can also be interpreted as "the self-determination of 
individuals and organizations concerning to the use of their data "[](cite:cites verstraete2022solid).
This means that individual and legal entities
"can choose where [their] data is stored and who is granted access to it."[](cite:cites verstraete2022solid)
In this PhD program, I attempt to move the definition of power and control,
in the context of decentralized web environments, from a more consumer choice 
[](cite:cites Terranova2000FreeLP, Curran2016ch1, Sevignani2013),
the right to choose who will use my data,
to a definition that includes the right of the users as a collective to make use of their data without relying on
a third-party distributor with substantial computational power.
In the context of data usage, sovereignty, and control are vested in the owner of the computational unit.
This ownership empowers them to make decisions that may diverge from the desires or interests of the users [](cite:cites Sevignani2013).
Additionally, it facilitates the utilization of "users" as products to be sold or as an unpaid source of revenue,
even when the data is anonymized [](cite:cites Terranova2000FreeLP, Sevignani2013).
For the purpose of improving this sovereignty, my emphasis is on querying because, in the case of social applications, the request for information, 
the discovery process,  particularly when considering complex concepts like serendipity [](cite:cites Smets2022SerendipityIR)
and the propagation of information is the core functionalities performed by those applications.
Concretely, I propose Collaborative Link Traversal Query Processing (CLTQP),
a Link Traversal Query Processing (LTQP) paradigm where every user can share
their computational power when querying. 
This collaboration increases query result completeness 
and reduces execution time for all users,
in essence creating a unified and powerful engine. 
With this collective participation, 
it would be possible at little cost to provide a more democratic economic base from which
users could have more power to choose features for social applications that cater to their
desire and interest and start social applications with a lesser monetary barrier.
This paper is divided as follows, first,
[related work](#litterature_review) is presented,
after the [research proposal](#proposal) is made,
then the [methodology](#evaluation) is explained and there is a short [conclusion](#conclusion).

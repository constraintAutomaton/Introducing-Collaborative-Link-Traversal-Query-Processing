[](cite:cites Rizwan2021) analyze the relationship between a corporate view on open source software and a libertarian one.
They define open source software as 
<blockquote>
a type of programming codes available to
public, in this case software coder(s) irrespective of
their geography or demography, who can further create
or modify codes freely as per their respective require-
ments, thereby giving the name “open source.”
</blockquote>
[](cite:cites Rizwan2021) claim that since the origin of the open source two visions already started to clash the more socialistic with ambition to decommodify the 
market for software (Stallman) and the more corporate vision that focus on the organization of the production (Raymond).
<!-- Let's put some references for those name -->
[](cite:cites Rizwan2021) also analyze the societal good aspect of open source software.
They claim that the open-source movement started on idealist notion (as opposed to materialist one) the notion that writing code is an act of free speech.
Those programmer movement expanded beyond software and criticize copyright laws and its relation with artistic expression and freedom of expression.
[](cite:cites Rizwan2021) argue using [](cite:cites Arslan2014) that open source gives freedom to programmers to use and change that open software,
which results that so software produce into that mode tend to be characterized by flexibility, modularity and a willingness to experiment [](cite:cites Hannemyr1999TechnologyAP).
In [](cite:cites Rizwan2021) article we focus more on the consequence of the programmer and the corporation and not much about the public,
even they mention gift giving, or solidarity it's more on the perspective of the person working on the software and not much from the "passive," as in the individual that only use the software, user.
Also, even though it is mentioned that that a number of proponents 
"have argued that the success of free or open-source software movement has been because of its association with socialist and communistic ideologies."
The article doesn't really present from the side of the "libertarian" materialist reasons that push them to produce free software it focuses more on idealist reason,
it doesn't either analyze the repercussion on the feature of the software, how does a "socialist" mode of production of software impact it's a feature on the end user, 
and on the software economy has a whole. It always presupposes that the programmer has the financial means to sustain itself.
An interesting argument made by the paper is the "deradicalization" of the open source movement and the co-optation of capitalism means, by the modification of slogans such as
“free as in free speech, not free beer” to remove the political connotation or the adoption of this mode of production by large enterprise to reduce their cost of production, with concepts like
["Indirect Commercialization"](cite:cites Krishnamurthy2006).

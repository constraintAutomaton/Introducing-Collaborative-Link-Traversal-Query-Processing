## Conclusion
{:conclusion}

In this article, I present a proposal for my PhD research and the state of the art associated with it.
My project aims at reducing the query execution time and increasing the query completeness when exploring the web of linked data.
The solution proposed enables query engines to collaborate in the exploration of data sources and to share of results through a P2P cache.
The potential of this proposal is to democratize the creation and usage of large-scale social media applications.

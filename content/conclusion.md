## Conclusion
{:conclusion}

In this article, I present a proposal for my PhD research and the state of the art associated with it.
My project aims at reducing the query execution time and increasing the query completeness when exploring the web of linked data,
concretely it consists of creating an LTQP paradigm called CLTQP. <span class="comment" data-author="RT">No need to repeat the name here again IMO.</span>
This paradigm enables query engines to collaborate in the exploration of data sources and the sharing of results through a P2P cache.
The potential of this proposal is to increase the completeness of query results and reducing the execution time of LTQP queries,
thus democratizing the creation and usage of large-scale social media applications.

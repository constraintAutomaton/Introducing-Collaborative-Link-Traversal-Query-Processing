## Conclusion
{:conclusion}

In this paper, I presented my proposal for my PhD research
and the state of the art associated with it.
It consists of creating a LTQP paradigm called CLTQP.
This paradigm makes query engines collaborate together in the exploration
of the data sources and the sharing of results via a P2P cache.


There are other questions that have not been explored in this proposal;
How to encourage <span class="comment" data-author="RT">enforce?</span> reciprocity in the network <span class="comment" data-author="RT">This sounds very important though; can you include it in your work?</span>, How to during the execution add new collaborative query engine and how to adapt the execution if a query engine is down. <span class="comment" data-author="RT">Can you refer to "adaptive query processing" here?</span> 

<span class="comment" data-author="RT">This section summarizes your paper, and future work, but it is missing the actual conclusion :-) It's important to talk about the potential impact of your work (short and long-term) (within research, and beyond), and repeat why it is important.</span>

## Conclusion
{:conclusion}

In this paper, I present my proposal for my PhD research
and the state of the art associated with it.
It consists of creating an LTQP paradigm called CLTQP.<span class="comment" data-author="RT">Before saying this, repeat the problem you want to solve with this.</span>
This paradigm enables query engines to collaborate in the exploration
of data sources and the sharing of results through a P2P cache.
One question that has not been explored is how to react to the addition or deletion of query engines during the execution
or, in other words, how to use adaptive query processing in CLTQP.<span class="comment" data-author="RT">Does this mean that you will do this in your PhD as well? If so, then it needs to be mentioned earlier.</span>
The potential of this proposal is twofold: increasing the completeness of query results and reducing the execution time of SPARQL queries, thus democratizing
the creation of large-scale social media applications.

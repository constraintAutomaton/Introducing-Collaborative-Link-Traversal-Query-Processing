## Conclusion
{:conclusion}

In this paper, I presented my proposal for my PhD research
and the state of the art associated with it.
It consists of creating a LTQP paradigm called CLTQP.
This paradigm makes query engines collaborate together in the exploration
of the data sources and the sharing of results via a P2P cache.


There are other questions that have not been explored in this proposal;
How to encourage reciprocity in the network, How to during the execution add new collaborative query engine and how to adapt the execution if a query engine is down.

## Conclusion

From all those strategy it would be also interesting to study if it is possible to add query engine on

Something to take into account with all those strategy is what to do if a SPARQL query engine is down,
or unable to communicate it's result, if some reactivity


- seed url might not work well if one.  After distribute if there some links. Warm point

- Global link queue for all the engine
    - One engine execute the query
    - Other peer 
        - Get the triples
        - get the link from the queue
        - main engine does the queue

- mecanism buildin for garentee of reciprocity
- Policies :

  abstract   = {This is a critical literature review of the open-source software landscape and what purpose it aims to serve by accelerating a debate in the field of IS about what open source means and how it has transformed the social and economic landscape of the software industry. As the general population has developed an increased dependence on information technology, the necessity for quality software offerings has also increased. This article attempts to present, interpret, and compare the two contrasting theories of the open-source landscape—the libertarian view versus the corporate view. Subsequently, it aims to delve into the battle of these two conflicting theories and what their interpretations present from the perspective of socially embedded lens—freedom or benefit (profit). This article will examine the differing opinions and dichotomy of the scholars from multiple angles and if the juxtaposition of these two theories creates the holistic view of the landscape.},

Both, the emergence of semantic web structures and research results on user behavior indicate that in certain circumstances, browsing in semantic networks is not only the more efficient search functionality in specific cases, but also leads to a higher user satisfaction. In this paper, our research objective is threefold. First, we want to explore currently provided search mechanisms in P2P file sharing systems in order to uncover a possible lack in the provision of user-friendly search functionalities. Second, we want to examine for P2P file sharing systems whether information browsing on semantic networks and keyword-based searching lead to significant differences in search efficiency and user satisfaction. Third and closely related to the second research aim, we want to additionally investigate the predictors of search efficiency, user satisfaction and usage intention in the context of P2P file sharing systems.},

  abstract  = {Since, the evolution of distributed operating system, distributed file system is come out to be important part in operating system. P2P is a reliable way in Distributed Operating System for file sharing. It was introduced in 1999, later it became a high research interest topic. Peer to Peer network is a type of network, where peers share network workload and other load related tasks. A P2P network can be a period of time connection, where a bunch of computers connected by a USB (Universal Serial Bus) port to transfer or enable disk sharing i.e. file sharing. Currently P2P requires special network that should be designed in P2P way. Nowadays, there is a big influence of browsers in our life. In this project we are going to study of file sharing mechanism in distributed operating system in web browsers, where we will try to find performance bottlenecks which our research will going to be an improvement in file sharing by performance and scalability in distributed file systems. Additionally, we will discuss the scope of Web Torrent file sharing and free-riding in peer to peer networks.},

  abstract  = {Although the Semantic Web in principle provides access to a vast Web of interlinked data, the full potential remains mostly unexploited. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that the architecture of the current Web of Data relies on a set of servers providing access to the data. These servers represent bottlenecks and single points of failure that result in instability and unavailability of data at certain points in time. In this paper, we therefore propose a decentralized architecture (Piqnic) for sharing and querying semantic data. By combining both client and server functionality at each participating node, and introducing replication, Piqnic avoids bottlenecks and keeps datasets available and queryable although the original source might not be available. Our experimental results, using a standard benchmark of real datasets, show that Piqnic can serve as an architecture for sharing and querying semantic data, even in the presence of node failures.},

Traditional approaches have either been centralized or use flooding to ensure accuracy of the results returned.In this paper, we present pSearch, a decentralized non-flooding P2P information retrieval system. pSearch distributes document indices through the P2P network based on document semantics generated by Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). The search cost (in terms of different nodes searched and data transmitted) for a given query is thereby reduced, since the indices of semantically related documents are likely to be co located in the network.We also describe techniques that help distribute the indices more evenly across the nodes, and further reduce the number of nodes accessed using appropriate index distribution as well as using index samples and recently processed queries to guide the search.Experiments show that pSearch can achieve performance comparable to centralized information retrieval systems by searching only a small number of nodes. For a system with 128,000 nodes and 528,543 documents (from news, magazines, etc.), pSearch searches only 19 nodes and transmits only 95.5KB data during the search, whereas the top 15 documents returned by pSearch and LSI have a 91.7% intersection.},

There are still many issues concerning hypertext that remain to be resolved, however, many of which are in the user interface area. One of the major usability problems with hypertext is the user's risk of disorientation while navigating the information space. For example, our studies [23] showed that 56 percent of the readers of a document written in one of the most popular commercial hypertext systems agreed fully or partly with the statement I was often confused about ‘where I was. ’ To investigate a number of user interface options in hypertext systems we designed a prototype system in the form of a hypertext report on events at the 1987 hypertext workshop. This system was implemented on an Apple Macintosh with Hypercard as the programming system. (To get a feel for our hypertext system, the reader is encouraged to review Figures 1 to 10 which contain screen dumps of a session with the system and thus constitute a kind of printed demonstration or guided tour.) Hypertext is a very dynamic form of human-computer interaction and can only be fully appreciated in an interactive environment. However, even these figures give a much better understanding of the system than a traditional textual description could give.},

However, determining the destination peer in the first place is not always trivial. We propose a model in which peers advertise their expertise in the Peer-to-Peer network. The knowledge about the expertise of other peers forms a semantic topology. Based on the semantic similarity between the subject of a query and the expertise of other peers, a peer can select appropriate peers to forward queries to, instead of broadcasting the query or sending it to a random set of peers. To calculate our semantic similarity measure we make the simplifying assumption that the peers share the same ontology. We evaluate the model in a bibliographic scenario, where peers share bibliographic descriptions of publications among each other. In simulation experiments we show how expertise based peer selection improves the performance of a Peer-to-Peer system with respect to precision, recall and the number of messages.},

  abstract  = {This paper develops a historical analogy between the pioneers of personal computing, or 'hardware hackers', of the 1970s and the seventeenth-century Protestant sects described in Weber's classic study. The psychological, cultural and sociological affinities of the two groups are emphasized, as are their roles in history. As Weber's Protestants are said to have instigated cultural changes conducive to capitalist development, so the worldview of the hackers contributed the idea—embodied in the personal computer itself—that has enabled capitalism to exploit information technology. The similarities between the two groups extend to the ironic historical fate of their respective belief and value systems. According to Weber, the Protestant sects were victims of their own success. Their stern advocacy of religious practice made possible a society whose dynamic principles tend toward the elimination of religious belief, while the Protestant emphasis on a life of diligence guided by reflection becomes valued for its utility rather than its intrinsic associations with virtue. Similarly, the hackers advanced the goal of ubiquitous personal computing because they invested their practice with a moral significance that revived older ideas of autonomy and empowerment through the exercise of reason. These ideas are effectively neutralized by design features of the con–temporary personal computer, especially its interface. The hackers' ideals seem almost anachronistic, while their advocacy of hard work with a PC has become a mere necessity of life for most people. In both cases, however, the radical, rationalist spirit at the core of the movement furnishes critical perspectives which, when reworked by subsequent thinkers, may inform critical practice.},

It argues that collaborative FOSS production by volunteer software developers is a species of critical social practice in Boltanski and Chiapello's sense: rooted in resistance to capitalist social relations, and yet also a source of values that justify the new routes to profitability associated with contemporary network capitalism. Advanced via collective projects that are sustained by hacker norms and privately legislated ‘copyleft’ law, the FOSS ethos is apparently antithetical to private property-based accumulation. Yet it can be shown to embody the ‘new spirit of capitalism’ in its most distilled form; moreover FOSS developers have instituted new forms of property and new modes of profit creation around software that are in the process of being adapted for use in other economic sectors. Meanwhile, the private law constraints on profit-seeking that have emerged from the FOSS movement are counteracting some of the social pathologies that accompany network capitalism only to consolidate others. The paper concludes by identifying likely bases for a renewal of critique given these realities.},

Individual user-programmers decide whether to invest their own effort to develop a software enhancement that will become a public good if so developed. The effect of changing the population size of user-programmers is considered; finite and asymptotic results are given. Welfare results are presented. It is shown that whether development will increase when applications have a modular structure depends on whether the developer base exceeds a critical size. Potential explanations of several stylized facts are given, including why certain useful programs don't get written.},

We hereinvestigate how social metaphors can be exploited effectively andefficiently to solve this task. To this end, we define a method for query routing, REMINDIN', that lets <em>(i)</em> peers observewhich queries are successfully answered by other peers,<em>(ii)</em>, memorizes this observation, and, <em>(iii)</em>,subsequently uses this information in order to select peers to forward requests to.REMINDIN' has been implemented for the SWAP peer-to-peer platformas well as for a simulation environment. We have used the simulation environment in order to investigate how successfulvariations of REMINDIN' are and how they compare to baseline strategies in terms of number of messages forwarded in the networkand statements appropriately retrieved.},

  abstract  = {RDF-based P2P networks have a number of advantages compared with simpler P2P networks such as Napster, Gnutella or with approaches based on distributed indices such as CAN and CHORD. RDF-based P2P networks allow complex and extendable descriptions of resources instead of fixed and limited ones, and they provide complex query facilities against these metadata instead of simple keyword-based searches.In previous papers, we have described the Edutella infrastructure and different kinds of Edutella peers implementing such an RDF-based P2P network. In this paper we will discuss these RDF-based P2P networks as a specific example of a new type of P2P networks, schema-based P2P networks, and describe the use of super-peer based topologies for these networks. Super-peer based networks can provide better scalability than broadcast based networks, and do provide perfect support for inhomogeneous schema-based networks, which support different metadata schemas and ontologies (crucial for the Semantic Web). Furthermore, as we will show in this paper, they are able to support sophisticated routing and clustering strategies based on the metadata schemas, attributes and ontologies used. Especially helpful in this context is the RDF functionality to uniquely identify schemas, attributes and ontologies. The resulting routing indices can be built using dynamic frequency counting algorithms and support local mediation and transformation rules, and we will sketch some first ideas for implementing these advanced functionalities as well.},

Compared with recent file sharing networks highly domain-oriented scientific documents are shared in relatively small research communities with tight internal and only a few external connections. The documents are annotated with small a but welldefined sets of metadata using standard taxonomies and are stored in many distributed, autonomous, heterogenous data repositories. As a recent development super-peer networks emerge improving the network performance by clustering peers at super-peers. By using Semantic Overlay Clusters (SOC) for clustering the super-peer networks we enable the creation of context-specific, logical views over the physical P2P network topology according to the research communities demands. SOCs define peer clusters according to the metadata description of peers and their contents. The respective clustering policy expresses the demand on the peers for a particular research context. In this paper we show how SOCs can be defined based on policies. We detail the definition of conditions that we use for our ECA-rule like policiy definition approach.},

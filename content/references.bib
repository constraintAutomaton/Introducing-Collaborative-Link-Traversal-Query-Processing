  abstract   = {This is a critical literature review of the open-source software landscape and what purpose it aims to serve by accelerating a debate in the field of IS about what open source means and how it has transformed the social and economic landscape of the software industry. As the general population has developed an increased dependence on information technology, the necessity for quality software offerings has also increased. This article attempts to present, interpret, and compare the two contrasting theories of the open-source landscape—the libertarian view versus the corporate view. Subsequently, it aims to delve into the battle of these two conflicting theories and what their interpretations present from the perspective of socially embedded lens—freedom or benefit (profit). This article will examine the differing opinions and dichotomy of the scholars from multiple angles and if the juxtaposition of these two theories creates the holistic view of the landscape.},

Both, the emergence of semantic web structures and research results on user behavior indicate that in certain circumstances, browsing in semantic networks is not only the more efficient search functionality in specific cases, but also leads to a higher user satisfaction. In this paper, our research objective is threefold. First, we want to explore currently provided search mechanisms in P2P file sharing systems in order to uncover a possible lack in the provision of user-friendly search functionalities. Second, we want to examine for P2P file sharing systems whether information browsing on semantic networks and keyword-based searching lead to significant differences in search efficiency and user satisfaction. Third and closely related to the second research aim, we want to additionally investigate the predictors of search efficiency, user satisfaction and usage intention in the context of P2P file sharing systems.},

  abstract  = {Since, the evolution of distributed operating system, distributed file system is come out to be important part in operating system. P2P is a reliable way in Distributed Operating System for file sharing. It was introduced in 1999, later it became a high research interest topic. Peer to Peer network is a type of network, where peers share network workload and other load related tasks. A P2P network can be a period of time connection, where a bunch of computers connected by a USB (Universal Serial Bus) port to transfer or enable disk sharing i.e. file sharing. Currently P2P requires special network that should be designed in P2P way. Nowadays, there is a big influence of browsers in our life. In this project we are going to study of file sharing mechanism in distributed operating system in web browsers, where we will try to find performance bottlenecks which our research will going to be an improvement in file sharing by performance and scalability in distributed file systems. Additionally, we will discuss the scope of Web Torrent file sharing and free-riding in peer to peer networks.},

  abstract  = {Although the Semantic Web in principle provides access to a vast Web of interlinked data, the full potential remains mostly unexploited. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that the architecture of the current Web of Data relies on a set of servers providing access to the data. These servers represent bottlenecks and single points of failure that result in instability and unavailability of data at certain points in time. In this paper, we therefore propose a decentralized architecture (Piqnic) for sharing and querying semantic data. By combining both client and server functionality at each participating node, and introducing replication, Piqnic avoids bottlenecks and keeps datasets available and queryable although the original source might not be available. Our experimental results, using a standard benchmark of real datasets, show that Piqnic can serve as an architecture for sharing and querying semantic data, even in the presence of node failures.},

Traditional approaches have either been centralized or use flooding to ensure accuracy of the results returned.In this paper, we present pSearch, a decentralized non-flooding P2P information retrieval system. pSearch distributes document indices through the P2P network based on document semantics generated by Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). The search cost (in terms of different nodes searched and data transmitted) for a given query is thereby reduced, since the indices of semantically related documents are likely to be co located in the network.We also describe techniques that help distribute the indices more evenly across the nodes, and further reduce the number of nodes accessed using appropriate index distribution as well as using index samples and recently processed queries to guide the search.Experiments show that pSearch can achieve performance comparable to centralized information retrieval systems by searching only a small number of nodes. For a system with 128,000 nodes and 528,543 documents (from news, magazines, etc.), pSearch searches only 19 nodes and transmits only 95.5KB data during the search, whereas the top 15 documents returned by pSearch and LSI have a 91.7% intersection.},

  abstract   = {Hypertext (3), (19), (25) is becoming a popular approach to many computer applications, especially those dealing with the on-line presentation of large amounts of loosely structured information such as on-line documentation or computer-aided learning. There are still many issues concerning hypertext that remain to be resolved, however, many of which are in the user interface area. One of the major usability problems with hypertext is the user's risk of disorientation while navigating the information space. For example, our studies [23] showed that 56 percent of the readers of a document written in one of the most popular commercial hypertext systems agreed fully or partly with the statement I was often confused about ‘where I was. ’ To investigate a number of user interface options in hypertext systems we designed a prototype system in the form of a hypertext report on events at the 1987 hypertext workshop. This system was implemented on an Apple Macintosh with Hypercard as the programming system. (To get a feel for our hypertext system, the reader is encouraged to review Figures 1 to 10 which contain screen dumps of a session with the system and thus constitute a kind of printed demonstration or guided tour.) Hypertext is a very dynamic form of human-computer interaction and can only be fully appreciated in an interactive environment. However, even these figures give a much better understanding of the system than a traditional textual description could give.},

However, determining the destination peer in the first place is not always trivial. We propose a model in which peers advertise their expertise in the Peer-to-Peer network. The knowledge about the expertise of other peers forms a semantic topology. Based on the semantic similarity between the subject of a query and the expertise of other peers, a peer can select appropriate peers to forward queries to, instead of broadcasting the query or sending it to a random set of peers. To calculate our semantic similarity measure we make the simplifying assumption that the peers share the same ontology. We evaluate the model in a bibliographic scenario, where peers share bibliographic descriptions of publications among each other. In simulation experiments we show how expertise based peer selection improves the performance of a Peer-to-Peer system with respect to precision, recall and the number of messages.},

  abstract  = {This paper develops a historical analogy between the pioneers of personal computing, or 'hardware hackers', of the 1970s and the seventeenth-century Protestant sects described in Weber's classic study. The psychological, cultural and sociological affinities of the two groups are emphasized, as are their roles in history. As Weber's Protestants are said to have instigated cultural changes conducive to capitalist development, so the worldview of the hackers contributed the idea—embodied in the personal computer itself—that has enabled capitalism to exploit information technology. The similarities between the two groups extend to the ironic historical fate of their respective belief and value systems. According to Weber, the Protestant sects were victims of their own success. Their stern advocacy of religious practice made possible a society whose dynamic principles tend toward the elimination of religious belief, while the Protestant emphasis on a life of diligence guided by reflection becomes valued for its utility rather than its intrinsic associations with virtue. Similarly, the hackers advanced the goal of ubiquitous personal computing because they invested their practice with a moral significance that revived older ideas of autonomy and empowerment through the exercise of reason. These ideas are effectively neutralized by design features of the con–temporary personal computer, especially its interface. The hackers' ideals seem almost anachronistic, while their advocacy of hard work with a PC has become a mere necessity of life for most people. In both cases, however, the radical, rationalist spirit at the core of the movement furnishes critical perspectives which, when reworked by subsequent thinkers, may inform critical practice.},

It argues that collaborative FOSS production by volunteer software developers is a species of critical social practice in Boltanski and Chiapello's sense: rooted in resistance to capitalist social relations, and yet also a source of values that justify the new routes to profitability associated with contemporary network capitalism. Advanced via collective projects that are sustained by hacker norms and privately legislated ‘copyleft’ law, the FOSS ethos is apparently antithetical to private property-based accumulation. Yet it can be shown to embody the ‘new spirit of capitalism’ in its most distilled form; moreover FOSS developers have instituted new forms of property and new modes of profit creation around software that are in the process of being adapted for use in other economic sectors. Meanwhile, the private law constraints on profit-seeking that have emerged from the FOSS movement are counteracting some of the social pathologies that accompany network capitalism only to consolidate others. The paper concludes by identifying likely bases for a renewal of critique given these realities.},

RDF-based P2P networks allow complex and extendable descriptions of resources instead of fixed and limited ones, and they provide complex query facilities against these metadata instead of simple keyword-based searches.In previous papers, we have described the Edutella infrastructure and different kinds of Edutella peers implementing such an RDF-based P2P network. In this paper we will discuss these RDF-based P2P networks as a specific example of a new type of P2P networks, schema-based P2P networks, and describe the use of super-peer based topologies for these networks. Super-peer based networks can provide better scalability than broadcast based networks, and do provide perfect support for inhomogeneous schema-based networks, which support different metadata schemas and ontologies (crucial for the Semantic Web). Furthermore, as we will show in this paper, they are able to support sophisticated routing and clustering strategies based on the metadata schemas, attributes and ontologies used. Especially helpful in this context is the RDF functionality to uniquely identify schemas, attributes and ontologies. The resulting routing indices can be built using dynamic frequency counting algorithms and support local mediation and transformation rules, and we will sketch some first ideas for implementing these advanced functionalities as well.},

The documents are annotated with small a but welldefined sets of metadata using standard taxonomies and are stored in many distributed, autonomous, heterogenous data repositories. As a recent development super-peer networks emerge improving the network performance by clustering peers at super-peers. By using Semantic Overlay Clusters (SOC) for clustering the super-peer networks we enable the creation of context-specific, logical views over the physical P2P network topology according to the research communities demands. SOCs define peer clusters according to the metadata description of peers and their contents. The respective clustering policy expresses the demand on the peers for a particular research context. In this paper we show how SOCs can be defined based on policies. We detail the definition of conditions that we use for our ECA-rule like policiy definition approach.},

The model is formally defined and its interest for distributed data management is illustrated through a variety of examples. A contribution of our work is a study of the impact on expressiveness of "delegations" (the installation of rules by a peer in some other peer) and explicit timestamps. We also validate the semantics of our model by showing that under certain natural conditions, our semantics converges to the same semantics as the centralized system with the same rules. Indeed, we show this is even true when updates are considered.},

  abstract  = {In a peer-to-peer (P2P) system, nodes typically connect to a small set of random nodes (their neighbors), and queries are propagated along these connections. Such query flooding tends to be very expensive. We propose that node connections be influenced by content, so that for example, nodes having many ``Jazz'' files will connect to other similar nodes. Thus, semantically related nodes form a Semantic Overlay Network (SON). Queries are routed to the appropriate SONs, increasing the chances that matching files will be found quickly, and reducing the search load on nodes that have unrelated content. We have evaluated SONs by using an actual snapshot of music-sharing clients. Our results show that SONs can significantly improve query performance while at the same time allowing users to decide what content to put in their computers and to whom to connect.},

The main objective is to discover peers with similar content and then form thematically focused peer groups. Efficient content retrieval can be performed by having queries selectively forwarded only to relevant groups of peers to the query. As a result, less peers need to be contacted, in order to answer a query. In this context, the challenge is to generate SONs in a decentralized and distributed manner, as the centralized assembly of global information is not feasible. Different approaches for exploiting the generated SONs for content retrieval have been proposed in the literature, which are examined in this chapter, with a particular focus on SON interconnections for efficient search. Several applications, such as P2P document and image retrieval, can be deployed over generated SONs, motivating the need for distributed and truly scalable SON creation. Therefore, recently several research papers focus on SONs as stated in our comprehensive overview of related work in the field of semantic overlay networks. A classification of existing algorithms according to a set of qualitative criteria is also provided. In spite of the rich existing work in the field of SONs, several challenges have not been efficiently addressed yet, therefore, future promising research directions are pointed out and discussed at the end of this chapter.},

Consequently, the combination of the Semantic Web and the P2P model can be a highly innovative attempt to harness the strengths of both technologies and come up with a scalable infrastructure for RDF data storage and retrieval. In this respect, this survey details the research works adopting this combination and gives an insight on how to deal with the RDF data at the indexing and querying levels.

Our study suggests that the peer-to-peer network does not have enough capacity to make naive use of either of search techniques attractive for Web search. The paper presents a number of existing and novel optimizations for P2P search based on distributed hash tables, estimates their effects on performance, and concludes that in combination these optimizations would bring the problem to within an order of magnitude of feasibility.

P2P computing is a potentially powerful model for information sharing between ad hoc groups of users because of its low cost of entry and natural model for resource scaling. As P2P communities grow, however, locating information distributed across the large number of peers becomes problematic. We address this problem by adapting a state-of-the-art text-based document ranking algorithm, the vector-space model instantiated with the TFxIDF ranking rule, to the P2P environment. We make three contributions: (a) we show how to approximate TFxIDF using compact summaries of individual peers' inverted indexes rather than the inverted index of the entire communal store; (b) we develop a heuristic for adaptively determining the set of peers that should be contacted for a query; and (c) we show that our algorithm tracks TFxIDF's performance very closely, giving P2P communities a search and retrieval algorithm as good as that possible assuming a centralized server.},

  abstract  = {Scholars who argue that social media users are exploited in the classical Marxian sense are making a fundamental category error. A case in point is work by Christian Fuchs and Paul Rey, two leading proponents who press Marxian categories into service to depict social media as inherently exploitative. Hastily applying "exploitation" to social media usage, their catachrestical mistake has negative implications for value theory and for emancipatory politics. Following a neglected lead in Dallas Smythe's writings, Marxist analysis should instead begin with social media's capacity to influence the value of labor-power. When assessed from this starting point it is evident that any increase in exploitation, due to wage-earners' private use of social media, occurs only indirectly as a second-order effect. Moreover, social media's organization-enhancing potential can help labor shift the balance of class forces back in its favor, thereby limiting rises in the rate of exploitation.},

One of the main problems it faces is rooted in its current architecture, which totally relies on the availability of the servers providing access to the data. These servers are subject to failures, which often results in situations where some data is unavailable. Recent advances have proposed decentralized peer-to-peer based architectures to alleviate this problem. However, for query processing these approaches mostly rely on flooding, a standard technique for peer-to-peer systems, which can easily result in very high network traffic and hence cause high query response times. To still enable efficient query processing in such networks, this paper proposes two indexing schemes, which in a decentralized fashion aim at efficiently finding nodes with relevant data for a given query: Locational Indexes and Prefix-Partitioned Bloom Filters. Our experiments show that such indexing schemes are able to considerably speed up query processing times compared to existing approaches.},

If data providers' HTTP caches plays a crucial role in LDF performances, LDF clients are also caching data during SPARQL query processing. Unfortunately, as these clients do not collaborate, they cannot take advantage of this large decentralized cache hosted by clients. In this paper, we propose CyCLaDEs an overlay network based on LDF fragments similarity. For each LDF client, CyCLaDEs builds a neighborhood of LDF clients hosting related fragments in their cache. During query processing, neighborhood cache is checked before requesting LDF server. Experimental results show that CyCLaDEs is able to handle a significant amount of LDF query processing and provide a more specialized cache on client-side.},

The reason is rooted deep within its architecture that relies on data providers to keep the data available, queryable, and up-to-date at all times – an expectation that many data providers in reality cannot live up to for an extended (or infinite) period of time. Hence, decentralized architectures have recently been proposed that use replication to keep the data available in case the data provider fails. Although this increases availability, it does not help keeping the data up-to-date or allow users to query and access previous versions of a dataset. In this paper, we therefore propose ColChain (COLlaborative knowledge CHAINs), a novel decentralized architecture based on blockchains that not only lowers the burden for the data providers but at the same time also allows users to propose updates to faulty or outdated data, trace updates back to their origin, and query older versions of the data. Our extensive experiments show that ColChain reaches these goals while achieving query processing performance comparable to the state of the art.},

  abstract     = {Query execution over the Web of Linked Data has attracted much attention recently. A particularly interesting approach is link traversal based query execution which proposes to integrate the traversal of data links into the creation of query results. Hence -in contrast to traditional query execution paradigms- this does not assume a fixed set of relevant data sources beforehand; instead, the traversal process discovers data and data sources on the fly and, thus, enables applications to tap the full potential of the Web.While several authors have studied possibilities to implement the idea of link traversal based query execution and to optimize query execution in this context, no work exists that discusses theoretical foundations of the approach in general. Our paper fills this gap.We introduce a well-defined semantics for queries that may be executed using a link traversal based approach. Based on this semantics we formally analyze properties of such queries. In particular, we study the computability of queries as well as the implications of querying a potentially infinite Web of Linked Data. Our results show that query computation in general is not guaranteed to terminate and that for any given query it is undecidable whether the execution terminates. Furthermore, we define an abstract execution model that captures the integration of link traversal into the query execution process. Based on this model we prove the soundness and completeness of link traversal based query execution and analyze an existing implementation approach.},

  abstract    = {The traversal-based approach to execute queries over Linked Data on the WWW fetches data by traversing data links and, thus, is able to make use of up-to-date data from initially unknown data sources. While the downside of this approach is the delay before the query engine completes a query execution, user perceived response time may be improved significantly by returning as many elements of the result set as soon as possible. To this end, the query engine requires a traversal strategy that enables the engine to fetch result-relevant data as early as possible. The challenge for such a strategy is that the query engine does not know a priori which of the data sources discovered during the query execution will contain result-relevant data. In this paper, we investigate 14 different approaches to rank traversal steps and achieve a variety of traversal strategies. We experimentally study their impact on response times and compare them to a baseline that resembles a breadth-first traversal. While our experiments show that some of the approaches can achieve noteworthy improvements over the baseline in a significant number of cases, we also observe that for every approach, there is a non-negligible chance to achieve response times that are worse than the baseline.},

LODStats consists of two parts: the core collects statistics about the LOD cloud and publishes it on the LODStats web portal, a front-end for exploration of dataset statistics. Statistics are published both in human-readable and machine-readable formats, thus allowing consumption of the data through web front-end by the users as well as through an API by services and applications. As an example for the latter we showcase how to visualize the statistical data with the CubeViz application.},

Imagine connecting these browsers using a browser-to-browser connection, sharing bandwidth and CPU. This builds a fog of browsers where end-user devices collaborate to process SPARQL queries over TPF servers. In this demo, we present Ladda: a framework for query execution in a fog of browsers. Thanks to client-side inter-query parallelism, Ladda reduces the makespan of the workload and improves the overall throughput of the system.},

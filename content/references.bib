  abstract = {This is a critical literature review of the open-source software landscape and what purpose it aims to serve by accelerating a debate in the field of IS about what open source means and how it has transformed the social and economic landscape of the software industry. As the general population has developed an increased dependence on information technology, the necessity for quality software offerings has also increased. This article attempts to present, interpret, and compare the two contrasting theories of the open-source landscape—the libertarian view versus the corporate view. Subsequently, it aims to delve into the battle of these two conflicting theories and what their interpretations present from the perspective of socially embedded lens—freedom or benefit (profit). This article will examine the differing opinions and dichotomy of the scholars from multiple angles and if the juxtaposition of these two theories creates the holistic view of the landscape.},

Both, the emergence of semantic web structures and research results on user behavior indicate that in certain circumstances, browsing in semantic networks is not only the more efficient search functionality in specific cases, but also leads to a higher user satisfaction. In this paper, our research objective is threefold. First, we want to explore currently provided search mechanisms in P2P file sharing systems in order to uncover a possible lack in the provision of user-friendly search functionalities. Second, we want to examine for P2P file sharing systems whether information browsing on semantic networks and keyword-based searching lead to significant differences in search efficiency and user satisfaction. Third and closely related to the second research aim, we want to additionally investigate the predictors of search efficiency, user satisfaction and usage intention in the context of P2P file sharing systems.},

  abstract  = {Since, the evolution of distributed operating system, distributed file system is come out to be important part in operating system. P2P is a reliable way in Distributed Operating System for file sharing. It was introduced in 1999, later it became a high research interest topic. Peer to Peer network is a type of network, where peers share network workload and other load related tasks. A P2P network can be a period of time connection, where a bunch of computers connected by a USB (Universal Serial Bus) port to transfer or enable disk sharing i.e. file sharing. Currently P2P requires special network that should be designed in P2P way. Nowadays, there is a big influence of browsers in our life. In this project we are going to study of file sharing mechanism in distributed operating system in web browsers, where we will try to find performance bottlenecks which our research will going to be an improvement in file sharing by performance and scalability in distributed file systems. Additionally, we will discuss the scope of Web Torrent file sharing and free-riding in peer to peer networks.},

  abstract  = {Although the Semantic Web in principle provides access to a vast Web of interlinked data, the full potential remains mostly unexploited. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that the architecture of the current Web of Data relies on a set of servers providing access to the data. These servers represent bottlenecks and single points of failure that result in instability and unavailability of data at certain points in time. In this paper, we therefore propose a decentralized architecture (Piqnic) for sharing and querying semantic data. By combining both client and server functionality at each participating node, and introducing replication, Piqnic avoids bottlenecks and keeps datasets available and queryable although the original source might not be available. Our experimental results, using a standard benchmark of real datasets, show that Piqnic can serve as an architecture for sharing and querying semantic data, even in the presence of node failures.},

Traditional approaches have either been centralized or use flooding to ensure accuracy of the results returned.In this paper, we present pSearch, a decentralized non-flooding P2P information retrieval system. pSearch distributes document indices through the P2P network based on document semantics generated by Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). The search cost (in terms of different nodes searched and data transmitted) for a given query is thereby reduced, since the indices of semantically related documents are likely to be co located in the network.We also describe techniques that help distribute the indices more evenly across the nodes, and further reduce the number of nodes accessed using appropriate index distribution as well as using index samples and recently processed queries to guide the search.Experiments show that pSearch can achieve performance comparable to centralized information retrieval systems by searching only a small number of nodes. For a system with 128,000 nodes and 528,543 documents (from news, magazines, etc.), pSearch searches only 19 nodes and transmits only 95.5KB data during the search, whereas the top 15 documents returned by pSearch and LSI have a 91.7% intersection.},

There are still many issues concerning hypertext that remain to be resolved, however, many of which are in the user interface area. One of the major usability problems with hypertext is the user's risk of disorientation while navigating the information space. For example, our studies [23] showed that 56 percent of the readers of a document written in one of the most popular commercial hypertext systems agreed fully or partly with the statement I was often confused about ‘where I was. ’ To investigate a number of user interface options in hypertext systems we designed a prototype system in the form of a hypertext report on events at the 1987 hypertext workshop. This system was implemented on an Apple Macintosh with Hypercard as the programming system. (To get a feel for our hypertext system, the reader is encouraged to review Figures 1 to 10 which contain screen dumps of a session with the system and thus constitute a kind of printed demonstration or guided tour.) Hypertext is a very dynamic form of human-computer interaction and can only be fully appreciated in an interactive environment. However, even these figures give a much better understanding of the system than a traditional textual description could give.},

However, determining the destination peer in the first place is not always trivial. We propose a model in which peers advertise their expertise in the Peer-to-Peer network. The knowledge about the expertise of other peers forms a semantic topology. Based on the semantic similarity between the subject of a query and the expertise of other peers, a peer can select appropriate peers to forward queries to, instead of broadcasting the query or sending it to a random set of peers. To calculate our semantic similarity measure we make the simplifying assumption that the peers share the same ontology. We evaluate the model in a bibliographic scenario, where peers share bibliographic descriptions of publications among each other. In simulation experiments we show how expertise based peer selection improves the performance of a Peer-to-Peer system with respect to precision, recall and the number of messages.},
